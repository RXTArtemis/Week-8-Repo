<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 Cups of Cake flour</li>
        <p> Cake flour adds that extra cakey texture to sugar cookies. Anything works from Betty Crocker vanilla cake mix to Pillsbury funfeti cake mix. If you don't have cake mix, don't sweat it! You can supplement cake flour with all purpose flour.</p>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoons of Baking Powder</li>
        <p>Baking Powder aids in lifting our delicious cookies.</p>
    <li>1/4 Teaspoons of Baking Soda</li>
        <p> Baking Soda aids in adding texture to our cookies.</p>
    <li>1 Tablespoons Cornstarch</li>
        <p> Cornstarch is our secret weapon and best friend. It is the key to super soft cookies. This is essential.</p>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoons of Salt</li>
        <p>Salt helps us balance out the flavor of our cookies. That way the sweetness isn't too overpowering.</p>
    <li>1/2 Stick of Unsalted Butter</li>
        <p>Butter at room temperature allows for seemless incorporation of ingredients. Is needed for both frosting and batter.</p>
    <li> 1 Cup of Granulated Sugar</li>
        <p> Sugar is essential. </p>
    <li>1 Egg</li>
        <p>Eggs allow for all the ingredients to mix together properly without getting any clumps or bumps.</p>
    <li>1/4 Cups of Sour Cream</li>
        <p> Sour Cream is another secret weapon. This aids in the fluffiness of the cookie and also helps with texture.</p>
    <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons of Vanilla Extract</li>
        <p> This aids in making our cookies super delicious.</p>
     <li>1/2 Teaspoons of Almond Extract</li>
        <p>This is optional, but almond extract balances all the flavors really well. </p>
</ul>

<h2> Instructions:</h2>
<br>
<ol>Combine dry ingredients in one bowl and set aside.</ol>
<ol>In a mixer, cream the butter (room temperatured unsalted) and sugar. Desired result is light and fluffy mix.</ol>
<ol>Incorporate vanilla extract, almond extract and egg. Beat together until evenly incoporated. </ol>
<ol>Add the sour cream and with a spatula (wooden or rubber) "flip" the sour cream into the batter.Rather than mixing we are incorporating it by flipping batter from the outside to the inside. This adds air and fluffiness to our cookies. This technique is similar to that of Macaroons.</ol>
<ol>In the wet ingredients bowl, add the dry ingredients 1/3 at a time. Mix until fully combined. </ol>
<ol> Cover Bowl with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. </ol>
<ol> Set up your cookie rack by putting cookie sheets on it while the dough is chilling in the fridge.</ol>
<ol>Preheat oven to 275 degrees.</ol>
<ol> After the hour has passed, use an ice cream scooper to create even sized cookie balls. At this point, the dough shouldn't be sticky. Before placing on cookie sheet, roll the cookie balls up and flatten them slightly. Leave cookie slightly thick.</ol>
<ol>Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes or until they are golden brown.</ol>
<ol>Cool cookies for 10-15 minutes.</ol>
<ol> Smear or pipe frosting on top of cookies and decorate them with sprinkles.</ol>
<ol>Enjoy your sugar cookies!</ol>
